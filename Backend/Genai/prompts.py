*   Exclude all `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
*   **Absolutely do not include any inline JavaScript** (e.g., `<script>...</script>` within HTML tags, event handlers like `onclick="..."`, or any other form of inline scripting). The HTML should be purely structural.
*   Do not include any inline styles (e.g., `style="..."`), or links to external CSS/JS files *except for essential CDNs as specified below*.
*   Don’t give JavaScript in this HTML code; I will ask for that later.
*   Add the IDs and class names only; no other attributes should be used that are required by JavaScript code.
*   Make it responsive for all the devices.
*   **If the project includes a header or navigation bar, make it mobile-friendly with a hamburger menu for smaller screens.** Structure the HTML to support a toggleable menu.
*   Use proper heading levels in a logical order (e.g., `<h1>` followed by `<h2>`, not jumping to `<h4>`).
*   Use `<button>` for actions and `<a>` for navigation — do not misuse elements.
*   Add `alt` attributes for all `<img>` tags to support accessibility and screen readers.
*   Add Font Awesome icons sourced from Cloudflare or jsDelivr to visually enhance the interface and increase UI clarity when needed.
*   Use https://placehold.co/HEIGHTxWIDTH or https://picsum.photos/[mode/]WIDTH/HEIGHT[.jpg|.webp][?grayscale][&blur[=level]][&random][#cachebust] instead of images to create placeholder visuals during development or prototyping.
*   Use form elements semantically (e.g., `<label>` for `<input>`) when applicable.
*   Ensure elements are keyboard-accessible — avoid using non-interactive tags (like `<div>`) for clickable elements.
*   Avoid redundant wrappers or excessive nesting — keep the markup clean and purposeful.
*   Use placeholder text or descriptive content where necessary to make the structure understandable during development.
*   All class and id names should follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., kebab-case or BEM).
*   Provide only the code in plain text format. Do not use markdown.


**VERY IMPORTANT**: Regarding external libraries/CDNs:

*   Analyze the project description to determine if it requires a common library (e.g., charting, PDF viewing, calendar UI, rich text editor, carousel, etc.).
*   **Only include CDN links that are absolutely required by the functionality described in the project.**
*   If the project description mentions a specific library (e.g., "Use Bootstrap", "Use Chart.js"), include its official CDN (from jsDelivr, cdnjs, or unpkg) at the bottom of the body section.
*   If a known library is clearly required (e.g., for rendering PDFs, charts, date pickers, modals, maps, etc.), include only the necessary **JavaScript and CSS CDNs** for that library.
*   **Do not include the integrity**
*   If the project description *explicitly mentions* a specific library (e.g., "use Bootstrap"), **include it using the appropriate `<link>` or `<script>` tag within the `<body>` ans use those classes in html code**.
*   If the project requires functionality that is *commonly provided by a well-known library* (e.g., date/time picking, charting, complex UI components) and the project description does *not explicitly forbid* their use, **you *may* include the appropriate CDN link within the `<body>`**.
